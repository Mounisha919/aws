A **cloud service model** defines **what part of the infrastructure or application is managed by the cloud provider versus the user**.

---

## 1️⃣ IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

* **Definition:** Provides **virtualized computing resources** like servers, storage, and networks. You manage OS, apps, and data.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A company needs **virtual machines** to run a custom ERP system.
  * They launch VMs on AWS EC2, manage OS and apps themselves.
  * Pay-per-use, scale up when workload increases.

**Examples:** AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines

---

## 2️⃣ PaaS (Platform as a Service)

* **Definition:** Provides **hardware + software platform** (OS, runtime, database) to build and deploy apps.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A developer builds a **web application** using Azure App Service.
  * No need to manage servers, OS, or runtime — just deploy code.
  * Platform handles updates, scaling, and security patches automatically.

**Examples:** Google App Engine, Heroku, Azure App Service

---

## 3️⃣ SaaS (Software as a Service)

* **Definition:** Provides **ready-to-use applications** over the internet. Users just consume the software; provider manages everything.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A company uses **Salesforce CRM** to manage customer data.
  * No installation or server management; access via browser.
  * Provider handles maintenance, backups, and updates.

**Examples:** Gmail, Office 365, Zoom, Salesforce

| Service Model | What You Manage       | What Provider Manages       | Real-Time Scenario                      | Examples                  |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| IaaS          | OS, apps, data        | Hardware, network           | Run custom ERP on virtual servers       | AWS EC2, Azure VM         |
| PaaS          | Apps and data         | OS, runtime, infrastructure | Deploy web app without managing servers | Heroku, Google App Engine |
| SaaS          | Just use the software | Everything (hardware + app) | Use CRM or email software in browser    | Gmail, Office 365, Zoom   |

# ☁️ Cloud Deployment Models - Real-Time Scenarios

---

## 1️⃣ Public Cloud

* **Definition:** Cloud resources managed by a provider, shared by many users.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A startup launches a **web application** using AWS EC2, S3, and RDS.
  * No hardware to buy; they just pay per use.
  * Scales automatically when traffic spikes during a marketing campaign.

**Example:** Netflix storing videos on AWS S3, Google Drive storing user files.

---

## 2️⃣ Private Cloud

* **Definition:** Cloud resources dedicated to a single organization.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A **bank** hosts its internal transaction processing system on a private cloud.
  * Data stays within the bank’s network for **compliance and security**.
  * IT team manages all updates and access.

**Example:** Bank core banking system, government citizen data systems.

---

## 3️⃣ Community Cloud

* **Definition:** Cloud shared by multiple organizations with **common requirements**.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * Multiple **universities** collaborate on research and share high-performance computing resources.
  * Cloud is designed to comply with research data security and privacy rules.

**Example:** Academic research consortium cloud, government healthcare research platform.

---

## 4️⃣ Hybrid Cloud

* **Definition:** Combination of private and public cloud.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A **retail company** keeps sensitive customer payment data in a private cloud.
  * Uses public cloud (AWS/Azure) to handle **website traffic and analytics**, especially during sales.
  * During Black Friday, workloads automatically expand to the public cloud.

**Example:** Banks or e-commerce platforms storing sensitive data privately but using public cloud for apps, analytics, or backup.
