---

## 1️⃣ Public Cloud

* **Definition:** Cloud resources managed by a provider, shared by many users.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A startup launches a **web application** using AWS EC2, S3, and RDS.
  * No hardware to buy; they just pay per use.
  * Scales automatically when traffic spikes during a marketing campaign.

**Example:** Netflix storing videos on AWS S3, Google Drive storing user files.

## 3️⃣ Community Cloud

* **Definition:** Cloud shared by multiple organizations with **common requirements**.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * Multiple **universities** collaborate on research and share high-performance computing resources.
  * Cloud is designed to comply with research data security and privacy rules.

## 4️⃣ Hybrid Cloud

* **Definition:** Combination of private and public cloud.
* **Real-Time Scenario:**

  * A **retail company** keeps sensitive customer payment data in a private cloud.
  * Uses public cloud (AWS/Azure) to handle **website traffic and analytics**, especially during sales.
